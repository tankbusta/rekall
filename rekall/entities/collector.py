    EntityCollector subclasses need to override the 'collect' method and the
    'outputs' ivar. EntityCollector takes care of registering collected
    entities with the EntityManager, deciding whether the collector should be
    called for manager-driven queries and ensuring collection is only done once
    per cache lifetime.

    Intended subclass overrides:
    ============================

    ### self.outputs (ivar, required):
    Override with a list of collection promises. Each promise should represent
    a component the collector yields on a call to collect, like so:

    outputs = ["Process", "Timestamps"]

    The collector may also specify a value it guarantees will be set on the
    entities it yields. The format for doing so is:

    outputs = ["Struct/type=proc"]

    The collector is not required to actually deliver on all of its promises,
    but it is not allowed to yield something it didn't promise.

    ### self.collect_args (ivar, optional):
    Collectors can specify the kind of input they want using a dictionary of
    queries describing the input, keyed on the names of kwargs they should be
    supplied as. The manager may call collectors with dependencies more than
    once, as new data becomes available.

    Examples:

    # ProcessParser wants proc structs. Its collect method will now receive
    # a keyword arg 'procs' populated with entities matching the query.
    collect_args = {"procs": "Struct/type is 'proc'"}

    # Socket/process relationship inference wants sockets and processes.
    # Its collect method will now receive two keyword args - 'processes' with
    # process entities, and 'sockets' with base object entities.
    collect_args = {"processes": "has component Process",
                    "sockets": "Struct/type" is 'socket'}

    ### self.filter_input (ivar, optional):
    Costly collectors can flip this variable to True, which will cause the
    manager to call self.input_filter to prefilter the ingestion set, giving
    the collector the opportunity to filter out entities it has parsed before.

    ### self.run_cost (ivar, optional):
    Should be set to a CostEnum value, estimating how expensive the collector is
    in terms of performance.

    ### self.enforce_hint (ivar, optional):
    If True, the manager will always supply a hint to the collect function. If
    False, the manager will only supply a hint when it's collecting for
    artifacts.

    ### self.complete_input (ivar, optional):
    If True, will cause the manager to always call the collect method with all
    available results for the ingestion queries, even if they've been sent
    before and haven't been updated since. The results can still be filtered
    with filter_input.

        Subclasses should override this to yield components that represent the
        data they collect. For example, a pslist collector would yield Process
        components. Only components listed in self.outputs should be yielded
        and no other.

        Output format:
        ==============

        In the simplest case, yield one component at a time. To indicate two
        (or more) components are related, yield both in a list (for example,
        Process and the Struct wrapping the proc struct representing it
        in kernel).

        Unless an identity is specified explicitly, one will be created
        automatically by taking the first field of the first component and
        instantiating an identity with it.

        To specify an identity explicitly, yield the Entity component as first
        in the list and provide the identity in its 'identity' field.

        Examples:
        =========

        # Yielding just one component at a time:
        yield manager.Process(
            pid=proc.p_pid,
            ...)

        # Yielding the process component and the BSD proc struct:
        yield [
            manager.Process(pid=proc.p_pid, ...),
            manager.Struct(base=proc, ...),
        ]

        # In both above examples, the identity will be "Process/pid=(PID here)."
        # Specifying an explicit identity would look like this:
        yield [
            manager.Entity(identity=ProcessIdentity(...)),
            manager.Process(pid=proc.p_pid, ...),
            manager.Struct(base=proc, ...),
        ]

        Optimization hints:
        ===================

        A hint may be passed to the collect method, in which case the collector
        may elect to only collect some information it's capable of collecting
        and not all. For example, a hint to the pslist collector may specify
        that the caller only cares about processes listed by walking the
        process head list. The format of the hint is currently not specified.

class Entity(object):
    """Entity is an abstraction of things like Process, User or Connection.

    Each entity consists of a an identity object, like PID, username or a memory
    address, and a list of components, which are data about the entity.

    Immutability:
    =============

    Entities and components are copy-on-write. Components enforce immutability
    while Entity and Identity are less strict for practical reasons.
    Nevertheless, changing an instance of entity or identity after they've been
    added to an entity manager will result in undefined behavior.

    Relational Model:
    =================

    Entites support associations with other entities. For example, a resource
    has a handle, a handle is owned by a process, and so on. These associations
    are implemented using Identity and lookups through an entity manager. See
    documentation of 'find_referenced_entities' and 'find_referencing_entities'
    for a discussion of associations.

    Merging:
    ========

    If more than one entity is added to an entity manager for the same thing,
    they will be merged into a single entity with all the properties, as long as
    the identity is decidable. For example, if we have a user with UID 15 and
    another user with username "Alice" they will remain separate entities until
    an entity is added with an identity that has the UID 15 and username
    "Alice", at which point the identity becomes decidable and all three
    entities will be merged into one.

    If, during merging, a conflict arises then both versions are kept
    encapsulated in an instance of superposition.Superposition. As long as you
    use 'get_' family of accessors on Entity this will be handled for you (as
    those functions always return generators).

    Superpositions:
    ===============

    Superpositions are technically merge conflicts, but they are not errors.
    They occur in cases where there are legitimately multiple valid values of a
    single attribute. Some examples:

    Resource/handle can have multiple values, because a single file/socket can
    be opened by multiple handles owned by multiple processes.

    Struct/type can be a superposition in case of unions, or things that
    are stored as a void pointer and cast depending on contextual state.

    User/real_name can often be a superposition because of variable formatting
    rules applied by the OS.

    Public state members:
    =====================

    components: An instance of ComponentContainer, which is a fast container
        object that actually stores the components of the entity.

    manager: The manager this entity belongs to.

    Special Attributes:
    ===================

    entity["Entity/identity"] (shorthand entity.identity, entity.indices)
    entity["Entity/collectors"] (shorthand entity.collectors)

        Out of the get_ functions, this is almost always the one you want.

        Getting a basic value:
        ======================

        Use key in form of Component.attribute. For example, "Process/pid" or
        "User/username". Same as calling entity[key]:

        entity["Process/pid"]  # PID of the process.

        What if the value is an entity:
        ===============================

        This method automatically recognizes attributes that reference other
        entities, looks them up and returns them. For example:

        entity["Process/parent"]  # Returns the parent process entity.
        entity["Process/parent"]["Process/pid"]  # PID of the parent.

        What if I want all the child processes (Inverse Lookup):
        ========================================================

        You can call entity.get_referencing_entities if you want to be explicit.

        Alternatively, prepend the key with a '&' for inverse lookup of a N:1
        assocation.

        For example:

        entity["&Process/parent"]  # Returns processes of which this process is
                                   # (Child processes).

        entity["&Handle/process"]  # Returns all handles this process has open.

        In most cases, this is unnecessary and aliases can be used instead.

        For example:

        entity["&Handle/process"]  # Is already aliased in definitions as:
        entity["Process/handles"]

        entity["&Process/parent"]  # Is already aliased in definitions as:
        entity["Process/children"]

        When does this return more than one value:
        ==========================================

        1) When doing an inverse lookup.
        2) When the value we find is a superposition.

        In both cases, a superposition is returned. Remember that superpositions
        proxy the [] operator, returning more superpositions. For example:

        # To return the pids of all child processes:
        entity["&Process/parent"]["Process/pid"]

        You can request more than one key in a single call:
        ===================================================

        This is identical to the behavior of [] on python dictionaries:

        entity["Process/pid", "Process/command"]  # is the same as calling:
        (entity["Process/pid"], entity["Process/command"])

        You can also request a multi-level path into the object:
        ========================================================

        The path separator is '->' and is used as follows:

        entity["Process/handles"]["Handle/resource"]  # Is the same as:
        entity["Process/handles->Handle/resource]

        This is merely syntax sugar to make specifying rendering output easier.

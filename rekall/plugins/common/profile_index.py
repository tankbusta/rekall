"""This module implements profile indexing.

Rekall relies on accurate profiles for reliable analysis of memory artifacts. We
depend on selecting the correct profile from the profile repository, but
sometimes it's hard to determine the exact profile to use. The profile
repository has index files that are used to lookup the correct profile quickly,
based on a limited set of symbols and offsets that are known, or can be easily
detected, about the image.

EFILTER type system.

class polymorphic(object):
    """Polymorphic function that dispatches on the type of the first arg.

    This function decorator can be used on instance methods as well as regular
    functions. It allows the function to dispatch on the type of its first
    argument, much like standard python instance methods dispatch on the type
    of self (conceptually, not in actuality).

    This enables us to define arbitrary interfaces and have already existing
    types participate in those interfaces, without having to actually alter
    the existing type hierarchy or monkey-patch additional functions into their
    namespaces.

    This approach is used in EFILTER to enable it to be easily added to
    existing codebases, which may already overload many operators and have
    their own conventions about how members of objects are accessed and types
    interact.

    Examples:
        @polymorphic
        def say_moo(bovine):
            raise NotImplementedError

        class Cow():
            pass

        say_moo.implement(for_type=Cow, implementation=lambda x: "Moo!")

        class Sheep():
            pass

        say_moo.implement(for_type=Sheep, implementation=lambda x: "Baah!")

        shaun = Sheep()
        bessy = Cow()

        say_moo(shaun)  # => "Baah!"
        say_moo(bessy)  # => "Moo!"

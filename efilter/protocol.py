EFILTER abstract type system.

The type protocols defined under efilter.protocols.* provide a very thin layer
over Python's builtin types, defined as collections of related functions with
defined semantics. Each type protocol is intended to uniformly support a
specific behavior across any type that participates in the protocol.

To participate in a protocol, two things are required:
1) Implementations of each of the member functions must be provided.
2) The type must be formally added to the protocol.

In this manner, we are able to declare strict compositional types on atoms and
expressions in the EFILTER AST and allow type hierarchies external to EFILTER
(Plaso Events, Rekall Entities) to be passed to the EFILTER engines without
casting or wrapping.

The compositional, flat nature of the type protocols makes it simple to support
basic type inference, by annotating each expression type with sets of
protocols it requires on its children and guarantees on its return type.

    If you need to provide a default implementation of functions in a
    protocol (for example, providing fall-through behavior for objects that
    don't participate in the protocol) you may pass this type in place of
    'object'. This will cause the polymorphic functions to fall through to
    this default implementation, but won't cause 'object' to be a subclass
    of the protocol.

    Example:

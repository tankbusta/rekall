"""EFILTER abstract type system.

This special protocol defines functions for an application/service level
delegate object, intended to provide type information and a global name service
to EFILTER. Implementing this protocol will enable EFILTER expressions to
reference globals and provide stronger type protections and hints in the
query analyzer.

    """Provide the type of 'name', which is either a global or part of 'scope'.

    Arguments:
        delegate: The application delegate.
        name: The name to be reflected. Either a global (from getnames) or
            a member of 'scope', which is a type or a container.
        scope: The optional type scope, which was returned by a previous call
            to 'reflect'. Used to qualify that 'name' is not global, but a
            member of 'scope'.

    Returns:
        The type of 'name' or None. Invalid names should return None,
        whereas valid names with unknown type should return AnyType.

    Examples:
        # What's a process?
        reflect(delegate, "Process") #=> Process

        # Invalid - must be scoped.
        reflect(delegate, "name") #=> None

        # Attribute 'ProcessName' of a Process Entity.
        reflect(delegate, "name", Process) #=> basestring

        # Plugin output:
        reflect(delegate, "pslist") #=> pslist
        reflect(delegate, "pid", pslist) #=> int
        reflect(delegate, "process", netstat) #=> Entity

        # Globals:
        reflect(delegate, "_PsListHead") #=> proc
        reflect(delegate, "p_pid", proc) #=> unsigned
        reflect(delegate, "void_pointer", proc) #=> AnyType

        scope: The scope the name was found in.

    Examples:

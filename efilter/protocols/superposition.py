"""EFILTER abstract type system.

The superposition protocol concerns itself with variables that may have several
possible values, and it is unclear which value is the correct one, or whether
there even is a correct value.

Real-world examples of when this happens include merge conflicts, roots of
quadratic equations, and programmers suffering from pathological inability to
make decisions.

def indices(x):
    """Return a list of keys to represent 'self' in maps.

    It is sometimes desirable to store objects in sets or dicts, which are
    not hashable. There may be two reasons for this:
    1) Mutable objects may not be hashable for obvious reasons.
    2) Hashable objects must satisfy:
       x == y -> hash(x) == hash(y).
       This requirement may be impossible to meet for certain types that
       can compare as multiple types, for example emulated C enumerations,
       which compare as either integers or strings, but can only be hashed
       as one or the other.

    The former is easily addressed by not using mutable types for non-ephemeral
    state. It's the 21st century, people.

    The Indexable interface addresses the latter, by letting the object return
    a collection of keys, here called 'indices', at which it desires to appear
    in any associative collection. The indices must themselves be hashable.

    See ext.indexset for more details about how indices may be used.
